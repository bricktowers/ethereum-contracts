# Brick Towers Ethereum Smart Contracts

## Overview
This repository hosts the Solidity smart contracts for [Brick Towers](https://bricktowers.io) digital asset services on Ethereum blockchain. These contracts are integral to our platform, enabling secure, efficient, and transparent digital asset transactions.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into multiple folders, each representing a distinct smart contract. Below is an overview of the folder structure:
- [eth-validator-fee-splitter](eth-validator-fee-splitter) - Manage and distribute execution layer fees, including Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) revenues.

## Usage
Each contract folder contains the following:
- `contracts` - A directory with Solidity contract files.
- `migrations` -  A directory with deployment script.
- `test` - A directory with test scripts for contract validation.
- `README.md` - Specific instructions and details about the contract.

To deploy or interact with these contracts, follow the instructions in the individual `README.md` files in each contract folder.

These smart contracts are released under MIT license. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for more details.
